# The Relationship of Demographics and Service Quality to Public Transportation Ridership

### Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for Graduation with Honors from the South Carolina Honors College

## Abstract
Public Transportation has proven to be an economic stimulus for many communities globally; however, the United States largely lags its European and Asian peers in network development, ridership, and quality of service. Compared to automotive infrastructure, public transportation provides better social mobility, investment returns, and environmental protection. This study analyzes the 2019 versions of the National Transit Database from the United States Federal Transit Administration, and the American Community Survey from the United States Census Bureau. Demographic Data and Quality of Service information are compared against measures of public transportation performance including ridership, revenues, and operating expenses. This study finds that urban areas with higher populations, higher travel times to work, and higher median household incomes have better public transportation performance. It also finds that capital expenses, operating expenses, and amount of infrastructure correlate positively to transportation ridership. This information can hopefully be used to better understand what makes public transportation successful and improve transportation access and quality throughout the United States.

## Introduction
Our urban areas are shaped by how we move within them. New York, New York and Los Angeles, California; Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois and Houston, Texas; these three pairs of American urban areas largely separated by their primary transportation methods. Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Houston have all embraced automotive travel, leading to vast networks of freeways and lower-density development. In contrast, New York, Washington, and Chicago all have established public transportation networks, pockets of dense transit-oriented development, and some of the lowest rates of automobile usage in the nation (Burrows et al., 2021). Compared to automobile travel, public transportation has been shown to provide better safety, better environmental protection, and better returns on investment. As former Bogotá mayor Enrique Peñalosa said: “An advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport” (TED, 2013).

Despite these benefits, America’s development has centered around the automobile since the middle of the twentieth century. From 1956-2017, federal, state, and local governments in the United States spent a cumulative $9.7 Trillion dollars maintaining roads and highways, compared to only $2.6 Trillion on public transportation (“Transportation Spending in the U.S.,” 2020). A rethink of mobility is needed to minimize the effects of the impending climate crisis. Transportation accounts for 64% of the world’s oil consumption, 27% of energy use, and 24% of energy-related carbon emissions (Mead, 2021). Changing methods of travel is one of the easiest ways to reduce individual environmental impacts; embracing public transportation could be the best avenue for the United States to meet future global environmental protection goals.

### Environmental and Social Sustainability
Compared to its peers, America’s current freight and passenger transportation systems are environmentally wasteful; from 2000 to 2014, the United States transportation system became less energy efficient, while global energy efficiency of transportation improved (Benoit, 2018). In 2005, the average American citizen emitted triple the carbon-dioxide emissions from transport as the analogous German, largely due to increased automotive use (Buehler, 2011). In addition to reducing emissions, public transportation helps to improve air quality, facilitate more efficient and connected communities, and reduce the need for automotive transportation (Federal Transit Administration, 2022). Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic provided insight into just how beneficial reduced automotive travel can be. Cities from New Delhi to Milan saw the best air quality index values in decades; many took the opportunity to permanently open streets to pedestrians and rapidly scale cycling networks (Mead, 2021). Shifting away from the automobile greatly benefits communities. Increasing public transportation access allows for far more sustainable land use patterns, promotes social interaction, and increases the health and well-being of a community’s population.

### Safety
Changing from automotive-centric travel patterns to public transportation makes overall mobility within a region safer; many of the key measures for improving traffic safety have been shown to improve public transportation success. The International Traffic Safety Data and Analysis Group found that the United States averaged 11.9 automotive traffic deaths per 100,000 people in 2016; they noted that deaths of car occupants, pedestrians, and two-wheeled vehicle riders grew from 2010-2016 in the United States, despite global decreases (International Transport Forum, 2018). Additionally, public transportation provides much lower fatality rates than automotive transport when normalized for distance. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics and American Public Transportation Administration found rail transportation (0.33-0.36 deaths/billion passenger miles) and bus transportation (0.20 deaths) fatality rates to be twenty and thirty times lower than automotive transportation (6.35 deaths) respectively (Litman, 2016). Public transportation can provide a previously nonexistent alternative to driving; thoughtful planning can prevent riskier drivers – senior, youth, and impaired – from posing a threat to others.

### Investment
Investing in public transportation has been repeatedly shown to provide substantial rates of return (Bekka, 2006). Benefits of public transportation are extensive and are often not fully captured in existing cost-benefit analyses. Transportation planning typically includes financial costs, operating costs, travel speed, crash risk, and environmental impacts, but more comprehensive models include equity, land use, traffic, and diversity values (Litman, 2023). Both users and non-users of public transportation benefit from increased investment in the form of travel time reductions, cost savings, and reliability improvements (American Public Transportation Association, 2020). Users experience the benefits by removing car-related expenses from their budget, and non-users benefit from traffic reductions. The APTA found that switching to public transportation could save a household around $6,200 annually, and found that both a moderate funding increase and a high funding increase would result in a five-fold annual return on investment (American Public Transportation Association, 2020). The Wisconsin Department of Transportation found similar results, with each of their scenarios producing returns of 332 percent to 361 percent (Bekka, 2006).

### Topic of Investigation
Public transportation can have a transformative impact on global communities, and much research has been done quantifying those benefits. However, there exists a lack of a national study to test the success factors of public transportation. This study aims to analyze urban areas within the United States that have public transportation systems. Two separate dimensions of analysis – urban area characteristics and service quality – will be analyzed and tested to determine if they significantly impact public transportation ridership. The results could help improve allocation of resources to new public transportation projects, enable easy identification of performance quality, and assist in contextualizing decisions on whether to improve or expand current infrastructure.

## Literature Review
The biggest questions in Urban Planning today concern how to design cities for the future. What methods and practices can minimize the risks of climate change, resource depletion, and population growth? How can positive health and wellness outcomes be maximized across a region’s inhabitants? Examples can be found throughout Europe and Asia including the land-use and transportation development in the Netherlands, China, and Japan. A new framework for sustainable transportation planning is “based on the principles of biological and ecological systems, looks instead at the overall pattern, texture, connectivity, and functionality of land use … within the system” (Replogie, 1991). Development strategy centered on automobile usage will severely hinder the success of any public transportation investment.

### The Netherlands – Innovative Land Use Strategy
The Netherlands can serve as a model for sustainable urban and transportation planning, currently laying claim to one of the world’s densest populations, and some of the densest and most cost-effective road and rail networks (Gokmen, 2022). Many systems in the Netherlands are planned and organized at a national level. Within the Randstad – a ring of the Netherlands’ four largest cities: Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht – lies the Green Heart, a protected area of green space to encourage concentration of population into the surrounding economic areas. The Green Heart was designed intentionally to prevent the area from becoming “a single amorphous sea of houses, such as of the world-famous archetypical urban sprawl in Los Angeles,” and has been largely successful, with the protected region having substantially lower rates of urbanization than the surrounding cities (Roodbol-Mekkes et al., 2012).

Many countries view the Dutch practices as inspirational, and the country has chosen to capitalize on its reputation. Dutch planners have organized sustainable development training Shenzhen, China; designed waterfront revitalization in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;  organized disaster relief in Tokyo and Turkey; and were a pivotal player in the 2050 master plan for Delhi, India (Pojani & Stead, 2015). Many Dutch projects were found appealing to international urban planners: tram lines running in mixed traffic, multi-modal hub infrastructure layout at the Port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport, traffic calming devices (Pojani & Stead, 2015). Administrative programs, such as Transit-Oriented-Development, and the implementation of a national standardized ticketing system – the OV-Chipkaart – are also exemplary administrative measures that greatly improve public transportation usability. Dutch planning practices show how a coordinated national strategy, centered on social and environmental sustainability, can produce extremely intriguing results, such as a flourishing public transportation network, and extremely high quality of life measures.  

### Pandemic-influenced Modern Planning Practices
One of the most recent urban planning concepts has been the fifteen-minute city: an idea that a person’s daily activities should be located within a short walk, bike, or transit journey of their living space (Abdelfattah et al., 2022). During pandemic induced lockdowns, many urban areas struggled to provide their residents with basic supplies due to stifled economic activity; an urban mobility re-think was needed to ensure economic activity could continue despite strict health regulations (Abdelfattah et al., 2022; Moreno et al., 2021). In response to travel regulations, many cities saw surges in bicycle use, prompting pilot projects which reclaimed space for bicycles from automobiles; Berlin, New York City, Beijing, and Copenhagen all experienced transformations centered around cycling as an effective form of transportation (Moreno et al., 2021). Moreno et al. (2021) provide a framework with four pillars critical to fifteen-minute city implementation: proximity to enable residents to utilize their living spaces, density to provide sustainability, diversity to encourage diverse neighborhoods, and the digitization of communication. The framework is flexible enough to cater to cities’ individual needs, whether its developing new centers of employment, building new housing to increase access to existing clusters, or implementing planning strategies optimized for remote and co-working.

An intriguing case of fifteen-minute city implementation is Paris. Previously, central Paris was bisected by an urban highway along the right bank of the river Seine, which contributed to extremely high rates of air pollution. Beginning in 2016, the highway was replaced by a linear, riverfront park, complete with bike lanes and pedestrian paths. The success of this project eventually led to successful mayoral campaigns centered around the idea of a fifteen-minute city (Gongadze & Maassen, 2023). For Paris, a city with existing high population density and an extremely well-developed transportation system, the fifteen-minute city strategy hoped to improve accessibility throughout the region. Paris’ plan focuses extensively on localizing food and services, making vehicle traffic prohibited in central neighborhoods, increasing availability of public spaces, and improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure (Pozoukidou & Chatziyiannaki, 2021).

Though public transportation is not explicitly a priority of the fifteen-minute city vision, systems will benefit greatly from the framework’s gradual adoption. Many new planning methods involve more active (walking and/or cycling) commutes, decreasing car ownership rates, and encouraging more sustainable forms of mobility between neighborhoods. As cities begin to re-embrace spatial planning at a more local level, public transportation will be utilized to enable longer-range travel.

### Established Success Factors of Public Transportation
Previous literature has provided comprehensive theory to explain public transportation success. At its most basic level, demand can be explained by “the utility of the trip and its costs: time (access time, wait time, travel time), money (transit fare), and uncertainty (schedule adherence, safety, etc.)” (Taylor et al., 2009, p. 3). However, more complex analysis is needed since perceived demand for public transportation services often varies with supply. Taylor thus proposes a model that summarizes public transportation usage “as a function of the collective characteristics of travelers, the physical and economic characteristics of metropolitan areas, the availability of substitute modes for travel, and the price, quantity, and quality of transit services” (Taylor et al., 2009, p. 3). This study groups variables into an external demographic model to compare the usage of public transportation networks nationwide; and an internal quality model to compare the operational successes of existing public transportation networks.

#### Demography
Research has shown that income and automotive ownership rates can predict transportation mode choice internationally. The opportunity costs of longer commute times increase with income levels, making commuting by automobile more attractive (Buehler, 2011). However, Buehler also notes that in industrialized countries, such as the United States, other studies have found that life cycle, age, and gender may provide more insight into public transportation mode choice. Studies on a per-line basis and at the urban area level have established a symbiotic relationship between public transportation and the surrounding demographics. In an analysis of a service suspension of the R train in Brooklyn, access to public transportation showed a significant relationship in improving employment rates (Tyndall, 2017).

#### Quality
Other analyses have shown that the availability of public transportation and the convenience of its service is an important factor in public transportation demand. Factors of public transportation, such as accessibility, frequency, routes, park and ride services, feeder services, and fare rates have an important role in predicting public transportation ridership (Chiou et al., 2015). Categorizing service quality into quantifiable measures proves difficult, as the perception of the service matters just as much as the hard product provided.

Service quality indicators have been grouped into six categories: availability indicators -modes, network, and operation frequency and schedule; accessibility indicators – ticketing and availability of internal infrastructure; information indicators – general information, travel information, and availability of staff; time indicators – average travel time and punctuality, comfort indicators – seat and ride comfort; and safety indicators – freedom from crime and personal perception of security (Cascetta & Cartenì, 2014). Analyzing both internal and external factors of public transportation performance should provide insight to guide policy decisions to identify opportunities for new public transportation systems, as well as provide a model for how to improve the performance of existing transportation infrastructure.

## Methodology
Data for this report was obtained from the 2019 versions of the National Transit Database (NTD) from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and the American Community Survey (ACS) published by the United States Census Bureau. This report chooses to focus on data prior to the COVID pandemic for two primary reasons. First, urban areas throughout the country implemented different levels of COVID restrictions – such as lockdowns – that limited public transportation usage to various degrees (Sung & Monschauer, 2020). Data from 2020 to 2022 would not accurately account for such an externality. Second, many public transportation systems in the United States are recovering at vastly different rates when compared to pre-COVID demand. 2019 was the most recent full year prior to COVID related measures, and thus provides the best sample to analyze. Each of the analyses will utilize correlation to identify relationships between demographic data, transportation system characteristics, and public transportation performance.

### Variable Selection
Within the NTD, data follows a relatively strict hierarchy. Each entry contains information for each Agency, each mode of service that transportation agency provides, and each type of service, whether it’s a directly operated service or a purchased service operated by a third party – for example, Central Midlands Regional Transit Authority (COMET) in Columbia, SC hires RATP Développement, the subcontracting division of Paris’ public transportation operator. Geographically, the urban area was chosen as the level of analysis. This is because, as shown in Figure 1, several agencies can provide the same mode of service within an urban area; and many provide service to multiple cities besides their place of headquarters. Thus, the urban area is the smallest relevant geographical unit to analyze. Data was aggregated as such, resulting in a sample containing 267 of the country’s urban areas from 49 states, and data about their respective public transportation networks. As many as 50 agency and mode combinations were aggregated in the New York, NY-NJ-CT urban area, and as few as one combination were aggregated in several urban areas.

Three sets of external independent variables were tested against performance metrics from the NTD. The first model concerns general demographic data. The second model tested income distributions to identify if there are specific income levels more likely to utilize public transportation. And the third model tested an education distribution to see if a specific education attainment is related to public transportation usage. Variable selection for the external analyses is shown in Table 1.

Four sets of variables were analyzed to provide insight into investment choices and quality of service. Variables were grouped into four separate categories: operating expenses, capital expenses, rail infrastructure, and road infrastructure. A complete list of internal variables analyzed is shown in Table 2.

The NTD provides six measures for public transportation success: fare revenues earned, operating expenses, vehicle revenue hours, vehicle revenue miles, passenger miles, and unlinked passenger trips. All six measures showed strong positive relationships to one another, a full correlation table is provided in Appendix B. For this analysis, dependent variables were tested against unlinked passenger trips; defined as the “number of passengers who board public transportation vehicles… counted each time they board vehicles no matter how many vehicles they use to travel from their origin to their destination” (Dickens, 2023, p. 1). Unlinked Passenger Trips provides a sound overview into the effectiveness of a public transportation system, accounting for variations in fare revenues charged, total distances traveled, and differences in mode of service.

## Descriptive Statistics
The resulting sample of urban areas used in the analysis was extremely diverse. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for the external analyses. In the sample, unlinked passenger trips in 2019 ranged from 7,350 to over four billion. The extreme variation of urban area composition within the United States provides an extremely useful sample to analyze relationships between public transportation usage and pre-existing factors within an urban area. Variables from total population to each level of the income and education distributions, show substantial variation and diversity within the sample. Figure 2 shows the distribution of unlinked passenger trips within the United States. As shown, the New York urban area is an extreme outlier, with over eight times as many unlinked passenger trips as the next. However, since the area has such well-developed public transportation, it provides a useful value for analysis, and the resulting correlations were sufficiently strong without its removal.

## Statistical Results
Many of the independent variables showed strong relationships to unlinked passenger trips across the sample of urban areas. Each of the external analyses returned at least two variables with strong relationships to unlinked passenger trips.

### Demographic Analysis
Running a correlation between unlinked passenger trips and demographic data for the urban areas in the sample showed strong positive relationships for total population, the percentage of the population that was foreign born, the travel time to work. It showed a weak positive relationship between median household income and unlinked passenger trips; a strong negative relationship between the percentage of the population which drives alone to work and unlinked passenger trips. Full correlation statistics are provided in Table 4. Many of these findings reinforce past findings in literature, except the relationship of unemployment rate to public transportation analysis. This analysis failed to identify a statistically significant linear relationship between unemployment and public transportation usage.

### Income Analysis
The income analysis showed statistically significant relationships between five income groups and public transportation usage. Statistically significant negative relationships were identified for the $25,000-$34,999, $35,000-$49,999, and $50,000-$74,999 categories. Statistically significant positive relationships were identified for the $150,000-$199,999 and the ³ $200,000 income levels. Full correlation information is shown in Table 5. Data show results that contradict most public transportation literature such as the analysis provided in (Buehler, 2011); this analysis found that urban areas that have a large upper class show greater public transportation usage, and urban areas with a larger middle class show lower levels of public transportation usage.

## Education Analysis
The education analysis found two statistically significant relationships between education level and public transportation usage; full statistical results are provided in Table 6. Strong negative relationships were shown between the portion of population having some college, but no degree; and the portion of the population having an associate degree. Interestingly, the results of this analysis also contradict the hypotheses proposed. In the United States, education level typically correlates positively with income level; many of the same insignificant relationships are found in both analyses.

## Transportation Expenses – Capital and Operating
Analyzing the internal success factors, every category of capital and operating expense showed a strong significant positive relationship to unlinked passenger trips. Full statistical results are shown in Table 7. Of note are the nearly perfect relationships between facility maintenance operating expenses ($r = 0.997$), vehicle maintenance operating expenses ($r = 0.996$), and unlinked passenger trips. This analysis shows that the distribution of capital expenses and operating expenses remains relatively constant across urban areas in the United States, and that any increase of public transportation investment can improve ridership, regardless of category.

## Infrastructure – Track and Roadway
The analysis between lengths of infrastructure and public transportation performance shows that increasing public transport network length usually results in higher unlinked passenger trips. Any entry reported as 0 miles was excluded from this analysis. Most types of track infrastructure show strong positive relationships to unlinked passenger trips. All types of roadway infrastructure, excluding exclusive high-intensity busway, show strong positive relationships to unlinked passenger trips. Full statistical results are shown in Table 8. Specific infrastructure sample sizes vary extensively between urban areas, for multiple reasons. Some building techniques are more modern than others and require newer technology; and some geographic constraints require different building techniques. For example, exclusive high-intensity busway is uncommon, as bus rapid transit is relatively new in the United States.

# Discussion
Testing demographic information of urban areas against public transportation usage confirmed some well-known success factors of public transportation; the analysis found that population and travel time to work both positively correlate with unlinked passenger trips. Both success factors are rather intuitive to discover. With population, the more people living in an area, the higher the volume of potential transportation patrons will be. Figure 3 shows the relationship between unlinked passenger trips and total population in more detail. With travel time, both sides of the relationship also hold true; as commute times increase due to traffic volumes, residents will be more likely to switch to public transportation; alternatively, as public transportation becomes more prevalent, residents could be more willing to accept longer commute times for the conveniences offered. As expected, public transportation usage and the portion of the population driving alone to work were negatively correlated; this also is relatively intuitive, as car travel and public transportation are direct competitors for ridership.

Some independent variables contradicted established relationships put forward in literature. In regards to median household income, this analysis found that as incomes increased, public transportation ridership increased. This does not indicate that higher income populations ride public transportation more frequently, only that urban areas with higher median incomes relate to higher public transportation utilization (Buehler, 2011). Figure 4 displays the relationship between median household income and unlinked passenger trips in more detail. This result could be due to the level of detail analyzed. Higher median incomes indicate a healthier economy, and urban areas exhibiting such characteristics could be more likely to have available funding to invest in public transportation. This hypothesis holds true in this dataset; the 7 urban areas with the most unlinked passenger trips – New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, San Francisco, Boston, and Philadelphia – all have median household incomes higher than $72,000 (z-score > 0.53).

Analyzing the datasets at the urban area level removes the ability to subdivide a network’s service area or ridership. The findings for unemployment rate and the percentage of population that is foreign born also seem to contradict accepted theory. At the urban area level, a relationship between unemployment rate and public transportation usage was not statistically significant. However, individual lines of public transportation have been shown to contribute positively to public transportation usage (Tyndall, 2017). Likewise, on an individual level, foreign born citizens have been shown to be less likely to choose public transportation over driving (Barajas et al., 2018), but this analysis finds that urban areas with higher rates of foreign born citizens have higher public transportation usage. These two variables highlight an important limitation and future research opportunity; since aggregation occurred at the urban area level, these analyses cannot be used to predict individual behavior.

## Income and Education Distributions
This analysis shows a similar trend with the income and education distributions. Figure 5 shows the correlation coefficients to unlinked passenger trips at the different income levels shown in Table 5; and Figure 6 is the same figure for the different education levels shown in Table 6. The two curves follow extremely similar trends: at lower levels, there is an insignificant relationship between the lower subgroups and public transportation usage; at middle levels – incomes of $25,000 - $74,999, and the “some college, no degree” and “associate degree” education groups – there are significant negative correlations; and upper levels, a positive relationship to unlinked passenger trips is shown.

**Figure 5**
*Correlation Coefficients to Unlinked Passenger Trips at Different Income Levels*

**Figure 6**
*Correlation Coefficients to Unlinked Passenger Trips at Different Education Levels*

This is likely due to the same problem exhibited in the demographic analysis. Since income and education are highly correlated in the United States, trends at the urban area level are not necessarily indicative of the ridership base. Higher income and education levels are indicative of a healthier economy, and as previously mentioned, could indicate an environment in which public transportation investments are increased. Larger portions of the population in the middle levels indicate lower overall incomes, and a potential decrease in public transportation funding. More research into how income levels and education levels stimulate or stifle public transportation is warranted.

## Internal Analysis
Both internal analyses – categorical operating and capital expenses, and rail/road infrastructure lengths – indicated that increases in public transportation spending relate to increased ridership almost universally. The relationship between total vehicle operations operating expenses is shown in Figure 7, showing a nearly one to one relationship between vehicle operations expenses and ridership. Both sides of the relationship between expenses and ridership are insightful. First, this analysis reinforces the idea that increasing funding will improve public transportation ridership. Second, public transportation budgets are relatively homogeneous across urban areas in the United States and operate at relatively similar expense rates to their ridership. Changes in expenses, regardless of category, correlate strongly to changes in ridership. This provides good evidence for the hypothesis that increasing funding increases public transportation performance, and future research for specific budgetary increases would likely prove the relationship.

**Figure 7**

The analysis of infrastructure produced similar results; generally, the more infrastructure a public transportation system has, the more ridership it experiences. However, four types of rail – at-grade: in-street/embedded, elevated: retained fill, below-grade: bored/blasted tunnels, and below-grade: submerged tube – and one type of roadway – exclusive high-intensity busway – fail to show significant relationships. First, the at-grade and elevated building techniques listed typically are used for light rail systems, which frequently have lower ridership than their heavy rail counterparts. Secondly, the use of bored/blasted tunnels varies extensively between systems; Washington D.C. has over 2.5x as many as New York, but only 9.7% of the ridership. Though specific types of infrastructure display differing relationships to ridership, both total rail and total roadway miles correlate positively with ridership. The longer a road/rail based public transportation system, the more ridership it will generate.

# Conclusion
The correlation models shown in this analysis reinforce the idea that both external and internal factors can have a significant impact on public transportation performance. Key details of surrounding demography, capital and operating expenses, and amount of infrastructure, strongly relate to eventual public transportation system ridership. As urban planning theory advances, and as the dire need for a more sustainable form of mobility due to climate change increases, public transportation increasingly becomes the answer. Urban areas across the United States have begun modernizing, expanding, and improving public transportation systems to better serve their surrounding communities.

Though this analysis provides a general overview, several opportunities for further research exist. Since the urban area was the smallest level of detail analyzed, an opportunity to run similar analyses for cities, districts, or neighborhoods exists. Analyzing the impacts of public transportation at a smaller geography can provide information about specific pieces of infrastructure, the ridership base, and the surrounding community that this analysis is unable to. Research conducted at this level could provide different, extremely useful conclusions. Additionally, analyses of specific modes of transportation could be useful, as the success factors for public transportation could vary extensively between commuter buses and subway systems.

However, throughout this analysis, one conclusion has remained clear: public transportation will never be successful without the resources required to support it. Communities globally can realize the economic, environmental, and social benefits of public transportation. Investing in public transportation over automotive infrastructure provides a safer, cleaner alternative that does not exist today in much of the United States. A commitment to improving public transportation represents a commitment to a better, more sustainable future.
