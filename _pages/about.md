# Background
Hi I'm Seth, a young professional living in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I've recently graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. I studied International Business, Operations and Supply Chain with a minor in German. In my free time, I run triathlons, play guitar, and explore all the great things that the world has to offer.
